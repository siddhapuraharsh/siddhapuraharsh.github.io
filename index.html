            <p>Helloüëã / Namasteüôè</p>
            <p>
              I'm Harsh Siddhapura, a Software Engineer with over 5 years of
              experience delivering scalable solutions across various
              industries. My expertise includes cloud computing, full-stack
              development, and AI innovations. Recently, at Arizona State
              University, I contributed to the Empowering the Pacific project,
              helping Fiji achieve its 100% renewable energy goal by 2030. I
              collaborated with cross-functional teams to deploy solar mini-grid
              software for over 75 remote communities, facilitating a $40
              Million investment in renewable energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to Arizona State University, I was a Senior Software
              Engineer at Entitled Solutions, leading system optimization
              projects that cut loan processing times by 40% and introduced a
              microservices architecture that improved platform efficiency by
              20%. I developed AWS serverless data pipelines, enhancing
              synchronization efficiency and user engagement by 25%.
            </p>
            <p>
              My strong background in cybersecurity includes co-authoring an
              IEEE paper on cost-efficient microservice deployment while at
              Samsung and The University of British Columbia, which resulted in
              a 27% reduction in AWS costs. At KPIT Technologies, I helped build
              robust security frameworks, improving threat detection by 15%.
              Proficient in Java, Spring Boot, Python, JavaScript, Node.js, AWS,
              SQL, Flask, and Django, I'm equipped to tackle complex challenges
              and drive business growth.

                      I have had the pleasure of working with Harsh for a year
                      as a Senior Developer and a Mentor to him. During this
                      time, I have seen his continual learning and ongoing
                      improvement - essential qualities for success in today's
                      engineering world - first-hand. For example, he took on
                      the challenge of completing a whole new module of Angular
                      for the Quick Heal XDR project, and gave a demo
                      walkthrough of the completed sprint to the clients, even
                      as a fresher. I have no doubt that Harsh would be an asset
                      to any team.
